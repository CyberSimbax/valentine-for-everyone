            <h2>To my forever Valentine, my Princess Galo ❤️</h2>
            
            <p>Days like this remind me how much I wish we were celebrating side by side. The distance makes it hard, but it will never change how I feel about you. So I created this little virtual space just for you — a small way to show my appreciation for our relationship and how far we've come, through the good times and the challenging ones.</p>
            
            <p>I want to remind you that you hold such a special place in my heart. I care about you deeply, more than words can fully express. Every sacrifice, every late-night call, every moment of patience and understanding — it all means something to me.</p>
            
            <p>No matter the miles between us, my love for you continues to grow stronger. You are my peace, my motivation, and my favorite person. I'm grateful for you today and always.</p>
            
            <p class="signature">Happy Valentine's Day, my love 🤍<br>
            Yours always,<br>
            Simba</p>
